\chapter{Project Agreement}
\label{app:agreement}

Sometimes you need to include a PDF document in the appendix.  It is perfectly acceptable to have most of this page blank as it acts as a cover page for the appendix. We use pdfpages for this include.  It lets you specify which pages to include, currently we have left it blank with \lstinline|[pages={-}]| but you could use \lstinline|[pages={1-3}]| for example 
\includepdf[pages={-}]{inc/NTNUProsjektavtale.pdf}
